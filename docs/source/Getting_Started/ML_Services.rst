Machine Learning Services
=========================

This section describes in more detail the requirements for data, setup & integration.


Automated Diagnostics
---------------------
Automated Diagnostics is a service dedicated to reduce Time To Diagnose & Time To Resolve. Instead of hours of data
analyses and field inspections, Machine Learning models can accurately determine the root cause of incidents and
directly instruct the optimal resolution.
This service is often the first to be implemented as it can be done manually, and therefore without intrusive
infrastructural setup. However, the manual approach is more time consuming than the automatic setup, as will become
obvious from the explanation below.

** Training Data **
To detect the root cause of a malfunctioning machine, machine learning models are trained on snapshots of data. These
snapshots are ideally short (~5 seconds) during which the failure occurred or its consequences are most noticeable.
